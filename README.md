# Horizon Refractor - Make Accessible

## Description
This project involved taking Horiseon's existing website and making it accessible. 

This was accomplished by: 
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing semantics in the HTML code.</li>
        <li>Adding alt text to images.</li>
        <li>Organizing and consolidating the classes in the CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>Making sure all links were working correctly.</li>
    </ul>

## Technologies Used
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ul>

## What I Learned

While working on this project I learned more about HTML semantics, the importance of including alt text for images, and how to be efficient with CSS classes.
By learning and implementing all of the things mentioned above, I was able to successfully make Horiseon's webpage acccessible to those who have visual impairments.
